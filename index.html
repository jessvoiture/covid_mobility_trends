        The initial outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 up-ended the status quo and brought the world to a halt with far-reaching and long-lasting ramifications. Individuals and nations responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by limiting social contact through voluntary isolation and lockdown policies in an effort to reduce infections.

        <a target=”_blank” href=https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility>Google’s mobility trends</a> track how visits and length of stay at different places change compared to a baseline period (January 3, 2020 to February 6, 2020). The data offers insight into some of the ways human behavior and travel patterns changed as a result of the pandemic. 
    </div>

    <div class="body_text">
        As the scale and geographic reach of the pandemic swelled in the early months of 2020, mobility and travel contracted in tandem. Mobility to workplaces, retail and recreational places, and transit all observed drastic reductions as businesses closed and people shifted to online school and work.

        In sharp contrast to many countries, the US did not impose a nation-wide lockdown. The imposition  of <a target="_blank" href=https://ballotpedia.org/Status_of_lockdown_and_stay-at-home_orders_in_response_to_the_coronavirus_(COVID-19)_pandemic,_2020> stay-at-home orders</a>  and other health measures were left to the discretion of state governors. This devolution of public health decisions engendered a partisan divide in the response to the pandemic with many Republican leaders resisting stringent policies and comprehensive lockdowns. Out of 50 states, 43 imposed some sort of stay-at-home order; all 24 states led by Democratic governors issued stay-at-home orders in their states, while only 19 of the 26 Republican governors issued stay-at-home orders. The result was a myriad of mobility restrictions and timelines in the US. However, communities and individuals across the states uniformly responded to the pandemic by voluntarily reducing their mobility—at a rate that <a target=”_blank” href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X21000895>outpaced health guidelines or policy restrictions.</a>

        The chart below illustrates the time lag between voluntary mobility reductions—as measured by the week when mobility observed the greatest decrease from the baseline—and government action.

    <div class="body_text">
        All states observed their largest decline in mobility within a week of each other, whereas the start dates of state stay-at-home orders span nearly three weeks. Of the states that imposed a stay-at-home order, all but two observed a time lag between voluntary mobility reductions and the imposition of the stay-at-home order. New York (NY) and California (CA) both observed their largest reduction in mobility during the same week that the stay-at-home order began. The decline in mobility prior to government action may be attributed to a trend of increasing cases, <a target=”_blank” href=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3599572>a sense of social responsibility,</a> or advanced warning of forthcoming policy changes. 
    </div>

    <div class="body_text">
        Nevertheless the efficacy of government lockdowns in reducing mobility and maintaining low social contact should not be fully dismissed. Many states lifted their stay-at-home orders by the end of June 2020 and failed to reinstate them during subsequent COVID-19 waves. The absence of state or national policy delegated travel decisions to individuals and communities based on personal risk assessments. In the 12 months following the initial COVID onset, the US experienced three subsequent waves in August 2020, January 2021, and April 2021. While mobility remained firmly below the baseline during these latter three waves, it never reached the levels of the initial lockdown in March and April 2020—despite higher reported COVID cases. This is likely attributable to the lack of governmental measures and <a target=”_blank” href=https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/publications/lockdown-fatigue-diminishing-effects-quarantines-spread-covid-19>lockdown fatigue</a> amongst individuals.

        The combination of personal and government responses to the COVID-19 drastically reduced mobility. During the first COVID wave, voluntary isolation outpaced state guidelines—especially in those states resistant to stay-at-home orders. However, 'lockdown fatigue' resulted in less extreme personal mobility reductions through subsequent COVID waves. Stay-at-home measures are effective. Their continued success depends on a considered and prudent approach to their implementation in order to avoid excessive lockdown fatigue and a negative impact on individuals’ voluntary actions.
