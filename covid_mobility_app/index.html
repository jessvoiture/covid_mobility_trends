        <a target=”_blank” href=”https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/”>Google’s mobility trends</a> track how visits and length of stay at different places change compared to a baseline period (January 3, 2020 to February 6, 2020). Thus the data offers insight into some of the ways human behavior and travel patterns changed as a result of the pandemic. 
    </div>

    <div class="body_text">
        As the scale and geographic reach of the pandemic swelled in the early months of 2020, mobility and travel tandemly contracted. Mobility to workplaces, retail and recreational places, and transit all observed drastic reductions as stores closed and people shifted to online school and work.

        Communities and individuals responded to the global pandemic by self-regulating their mobility—far <a target=”_blank” href=”https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X21000895”>outpacing health guidelines or policy restrictions.</a> This trend was observed in the United States. However, in sharp contrast to many countries, the US did not impose a nation-wide lockdown. The imposition  of <a target="_blank" href="https://ballotpedia.org/Status_of_lockdown_and_stay-at-home_orders_in_response_to_the_coronavirus_(COVID-19)_pandemic,_2020"> stay-at-home orders</a>  and other health measures were left to the discretion of state governors and resulted in a myriad of mobility restrictions and timelines. The devolution of public health decisions engendered a partisan divide in the response to the pandemic with many states headed by Republican leadership resisting stringent policies and comprehensive lockdowns. Out of 50 states, 43 imposed some sort of stay-at-home order; all 24 states led by Democratic governors issued stay-at-home orders in their states, while only 19 of the 26 Republican governors issued stay-at-home orders.

        The chart below illustrates the delay between voluntary mobility reductions—as measured by the week when mobility observed the greatest decrease from the baseline—and government action.

        Of the states that imposed a stay-at-home order, all but two observed a time lag between voluntary mobility reductions and the imposition of the stay-at-home order. New York (NY) and California (CA) both observed their largest reduction in mobility during the same week that the stay-at-home order began. The decline in mobility prior to government action may be attributed to a trend of increasing cases, <a target=”_blank” href=”https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3599572” >a sense of social responsibility,</a> or advanced warning of forthcoming policy changes. 
    </div>

    <div class="body_text">
        Nevertheless the efficacy of government lockdowns in reducing mobility and maintaining low social contact should not be fully dismissed. Many states lifted their stay-at-home orders by the end of June 2020 and failed to reinstate them during subsequent COVID-19 waves.The absence of state or national policy delegated individuals and communities to make their own mobility decisions based on personal risk assessments. In the year following the initial COVID onset, the US experienced three subsequent waves in August 2020, January 2021, and April 2021. While mobility remained firmly below the baseline during these latter three waves, it never reached the levels of the initial lockdown in March 2020—even with higher reported COVID cases. This is likely attributable to the lack of governmental measures and <a target=”_blank” href=”https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/files/growthlab/files/2021-02-cid-wp-391-covid-lockdown-fatigue.pdf”>lockdown fatigue</a> amongst individuals.
